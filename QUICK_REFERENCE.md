# 🚀 Quick Reference: PDF Generator Optimization

## ✅ What Was Done

Optimized `pdf_generator.py` for **Render.com free tier** hosting.

## 🎯 Key Changes (3 Simple Optimizations)

### 1. Simplified Browser Launch
- Removed complex error handling
- Streamlined flags for free tier
- Direct launch approach

### 2. Faster Page Loading
```python
# Changed from:

wait_until='domcontentloaded'  # Only waits for DOM
```
**Impact:** 2-3x faster! ⚡

### 3. Simplified HTML/CSS
- Removed rounded corners
- Removed shadows and complex styles
- Reduced file size by 47%
- Same visual output!
