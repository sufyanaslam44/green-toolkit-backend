## 🌐 Render.com Environment

### **Playwright Package:**
- **Version:** `1.48.0` (from requirements.txt)
- **Location:** `/opt/render/project/src/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages`
- **Installed via:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### **Chromium Browser:**
- **Expected Version:** `130.0.6723.31`
- **Expected Build:** `v1140`
- **Expected Path:** `/opt/render/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-1140/chrome-linux/chrome`
- **Current Status:** ❌ **NOT DOWNLOADED** (cached build issue)

### **Build Command (from render.yaml):**
```yaml
buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt && python -m playwright install chromium
```

### **Environment Variables:**
```yaml
PYTHON_VERSION: 3.13.0
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH: /opt/render/.cache/ms-playwright
```

### **Current Error on Render:**
```
BrowserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist at /opt/render/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-1140/chrome-linux/chrome
```

**Root Cause:** Render is using a cached build that skipped the Chromium download step.

## 🔄 Version Matching Status

### ✅ **Playwright Package - MATCHED**
Both environments use the exact same Playwright version:
- Local: `playwright==1.48.0` ✅
- Render: `playwright==1.48.0` ✅

### ✅ **Chromium Browser - MATCHED (Once Downloaded)**
Both environments expect the same Chromium version:
- Local: `130.0.6723.31 (build v1140)` ✅
- Render: `130.0.6723.31 (build v1140)` ⏳ (needs download)

### 🎯 **Compatibility**
Playwright 1.48.0 ships with Chromium build v1140 (version 130.0.6723.31)

---

## 📝 requirements.txt Configuration

**Current configuration (CORRECT):**
```txt
playwright==1.48.0
```

**What gets installed:**
1. ✅ Playwright Python package (1.48.0)
2. ✅ Dependencies: greenlet==3.1.1, pyee==12.0.0
3. ⚠️ Chromium browser (requires separate `playwright install chromium` command)

---

## 🚨 Why Render Deployment Failed

### **The Problem:**
Render's build cache prevented Chromium from being downloaded:

1. ✅ `pip install -r requirements.txt` → Installed Playwright 1.48.0 package
2. ❌ `python -m playwright install chromium` → Skipped due to cache
3. ❌ Runtime: Browser executable not found

### **Evidence from Render Logs:**
```
[PDF] Chromium executable: /opt/render/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-1140/chrome-linux/chrome
[PDF] Browser launch failed: Executable doesn't exist
```

The path is correct, but the file was never downloaded!

## ✅ Solution: Clear Render Build Cache

### **Required Action:**
1. Go to Render Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Click your service: `green-toolkit-backend`
3. Click "Manual Deploy" dropdown
4. Select **"Clear build cache & deploy"** ⚠️
5. Wait 5-10 minutes

### **Expected Build Output (After Cache Clear):**
```bash
==> Installing Python dependencies...
Successfully installed playwright-1.48.0 ✓

==> Running: python -m playwright install chromium
Downloading Chromium 130.0.6723.31 (playwright build v1140)
147 MiB [====================] 100%
Chromium 130.0.6723.31 (playwright build v1140) downloaded to /opt/render/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-1140 ✓

==> Build completed successfully!
```

### **Expected Runtime Logs (After Fix):**
```bash
🚀 Green Toolkit Backend Starting...
[PDF] Checking Chromium availability...
[PDF] Chromium executable: /opt/render/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-1140/chrome-linux/chrome
✅ Chromium executable verified
INFO:     Application startup complete

## 🧪 Verification Commands

### **Check Local Playwright Version:**
```powershell
cd "D:\Webtool\VS project\green-toolkit-backend\green-toolkit-backend"
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip show playwright
```

### **Check Local Chromium Version:**
```powershell
cd "D:\Webtool\VS project\green-toolkit-backend\green-toolkit-backend"
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -c "from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright; p = sync_playwright().start(); browser = p.chromium.launch(); print(f'Version: {browser.version}'); browser.close(); p.stop()"
```

### **Check Render Logs:**
After deployment, check Render's runtime logs for:
```
✅ Chromium found at: /opt/render/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-1140/chrome-linux/chrome
```

## 📊 Dependency Tree

```
playwright==1.48.0
├── greenlet==3.1.1          ✅ Installed
├── pyee==12.0.0             ✅ Installed
└── [Chromium 130.0.6723.31] ⚠️ Requires: python -m playwright install chromium

## 💡 Best Practices

### **Always Match Versions:**
1. ✅ Pin Playwright version in requirements.txt
2. ✅ Use `python -m playwright install chromium` (not just `playwright install`)
3. ✅ Clear cache when changing Playwright versions
4. ✅ Test locally before deploying

### **Troubleshooting:**
```bash
# If browsers not installed locally
python -m playwright install chromium

# If need specific version
pip install playwright==1.48.0
python -m playwright install chromium

# Force reinstall browsers
python -m playwright install --force chromium
```
