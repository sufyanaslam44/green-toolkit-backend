# üîÑ How to Update Render.com Deployment

## Method 1: Automatic Deployment (When You Make Code Changes)

Render automatically deploys when you push to GitHub:

```bash
# 1. Make your code changes
# 2. Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"

# 3. Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# 4. Render automatically detects the push and deploys
# Watch the build logs in Render Dashboard
```

**Deployment Time:** ~5-10 minutes

---

## Method 2: Manual Deploy (Force Redeploy Without Code Changes)

### Option A: Quick Deploy (Uses Cache)
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Click your service: `green-toolkit-backend`
3. Click **"Manual Deploy"** dropdown
4. Select **"Deploy latest commit"**
5. Wait ~3-5 minutes

### Option B: Clean Deploy (Clears Cache) ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Click your service: `green-toolkit-backend`
3. Click **"Manual Deploy"** dropdown
4. Select **"Clear build cache & deploy"**
5. Wait ~5-10 minutes

> **When to use Clear Cache:**
> - Playwright/browser version issues
> - Dependency conflicts
> - Mysterious build failures
> - After changing build commands

## Method 3: Rollback to Previous Version

If new deployment breaks something:

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Click your service: `green-toolkit-backend`
3. Go to **"Events"** tab
4. Find the working deployment
5. Click **"Rollback to this version"**

## üêõ Troubleshooting Failed Deployments

### Build Fails
1. Check build logs for error message
2. Verify `requirements.txt` has no conflicts
3. Try clearing build cache
4. Check Python version (3.11 or 3.13 recommended)

### Deployment Succeeds But Service Crashes
1. Check runtime logs
2. Verify start command: `python run_server.py`
3. Check if PORT environment variable is used
4. Verify Chromium installed correctly

### PDF Generation Fails
1. Check runtime logs for Chromium path
2. Verify Playwright version matches Chromium build
3. Clear build cache if needed
4. Check memory usage (may need to upgrade plan)
